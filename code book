# Run_Analysis executes the following steps.

# first, it runs dplyr and sets the working directory to "UCI HAR Dataset".

# read data

Then, it reads the data and makes the following variables: 

features  from features.txt
activities from activity_labels.txt
subjecttest from test/subject_test.txt
xtest from test/X_test.txt
ytest from test/y_test.txt
subjecttrain from read.table
xtrain from train/X_train.txt
ytrain from train/y_train.txt

# Then, tables are bound together.

the rows of xtrain and xtest are bound.
The rows of ytrain and ytest are bound
The rows of subjecttrain and subjecttest are bound
The columns of the above 3 are bound.

# select necessary columns

THe subject and code columns, as well as those containing "mean" and "std", are selected and put into a new tidy matrix.

# add activity names

The code column is replaced with the names that the codes refer to.

# Column names are fixed to be clearer

tBody is replaced with TimeBody
Acc is replaced with Accelerometer
Gyro is replaced with Gyroscope
Mag is replaced with magnitude
BodyBody is replaced with Body
mean is replaced with Mean
angle is replaced with Angle
gravity is replaced with Gravity
t is replaced with Time
f is replaced with Frequency

# Summarize by subject and activity

The above table is summarized by subject and activity, and the means for each category are given.

# The table is then written as final.txt
